# JSON Scene File Format

This document describes the structure of scene files that can be loaded by Donut's `Scene` class.

The scene loader looks at the file extension, and if it's `.gltf` or `.glb`, loads that model directly, otherwise treats the input as the custom scene description documented here. So, when Donut-based applications take a scene path on the command line, usually that scene can be either a single glTF model or this scene description.

The loader implementation can be found in [`Scene.cpp`](../src/engine/Scene.cpp) inside the `LoadWithExecutor` function and other functions called from there.

## 1. Top-Level Structure

A scene file is a JSON object with the following top-level properties:

| Property      | Type            | Description  
|---------------|-----------------|--------------
| `models`      | array of string | Each string is a path to a model file (e.g., `.gltf`, `.glb`), relative to the scene file location.<br/>Currently, only glTF 2.0 models are supported.
| `graph`       | array of object | See the section on [`scene graph node objects`](#2-scene-graph-node-objects)
| `animations`  | array of object | See the section on [`animation objects`](#3-animation-objects)

## 2. Scene graph node objects

The `graph` section contains an array of node objects, where each node may contain child nodes inside its `children` property.

Every node object may have the following properties:

| Property      | Type                  | Description  
|---------------|-----------------------|--------------
| `name`        | string                | Name of the node
| `parent`      | string                | Path of the custom parent node, as a sequence of names separated by `/` starting from the scene root.<br/>Normally, graph nodes are attached to their parent node in the JSON structure, but this property allows attaching nodes to anything, including inside scene graphs of the model files.
| `model`       | integer               | Index into the `models` array. If specified, an instance of the model is created and attached at this node
| `translation` | 3-vector (*)          | Translation vector
| `rotation`    | 4-vector              | Quaternion rotation in XYZW format
| `euler`       | 3-vector              | Euler angles in radians (used if `rotation` is not present)
| `scaling`     | 3-vector              | Scaling vector
| `children`    | array of node objects | Child nodes
| `type`        | string                | Leaf type for custom node content. The custom node types are defined by `SceneTypeFactory::CreateLeaf`, which user code may override to support more node types

*Note* (*): The "N-vector" notation means an array of N numbers, or a single number that is broadcasted to every element of the vector.

Additional properties may be specified for leaf nodes, depending on the node type. The default implementation of `SceneTypeFactory` supports the following node types and their properties:

### `DirectionalLight`

Represents a basic directional light with or without area, shining along the light node's negative Z axis.

| Property      | Type                  | Description  
|---------------|-----------------------|--------------

| `irradiance`  | number                | Light intensity, defined as illuminance of surfaces lit by the light at normal direction, in lm/m^2
| `angularSize` | number                | Angular lsize of the light, in degrees, default is 0

### `PointLight`

| `range`       | number     | Maximum effective range of the light, default is infinite

### `SpotLight`

Represents a spotlight emitting a cone of light from its position with a smooth falloff between the inner and outer angles. The angles are measured from the light node's negative Z axis.

| Property      | Type       | Description  
|---------------|------------|--------------
| `color`       | 3-vector   | Color of the light, default is white [1, 1, 1]

| `outerAngle`  | number     | Apex angle of the outer cone in degrees, default is 180

### `PerspectiveCamera`

Represents a perspective camera with specific projection parameters.

| Property      | Type       | Description

| `zFar`        | number     | Far clipping plane in world units, default is no far plane (reverse infinite projection)

## 3. Animation objects

The `animations` section contains an array of animation objects, where each object defines animation channels for scene nodes or materials.

For more information, see [`KeyframeAnimation.cpp`](../src/engine/KeyframeAnimation.cpp)
